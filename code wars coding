A rectangle with sides equal to even integers a and b is drawn on the Cartesian plane. Its center (the intersection point of its diagonals) coincides with the point (0, 0), but the sides of the rectangle are not parallel to the axes; instead, they are forming 45 degree angles with the axes.

How many points with integer coordinates are located inside the given rectangle (including on its sides)?

Example
For a = 6 and b = 4, the output should be 23
def rectangle_rotation():
    # c is a variable to keep the loop going until the loop is met
    c=True
    while c==True:
        #a is the width b is the length
        a=int(input("what is the width of the rectangle"))
        b=int(input("what is the length of the rectangle"))
        #e and f are variables to validate the conditions needed to work out the rectangle
        e=a/2
        f=b/2
        if type(e)==int and type(f)==int and 2<=a<=10000 and 2<=b<=10000:
            c=False
